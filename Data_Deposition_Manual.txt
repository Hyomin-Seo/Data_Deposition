#################################### GEO #######################################


#################################### dbGAP #####################################
Assumption: you are adding/ fixing the already-submitted study's data, not starting a new study
#################################### dbGAP #####################################
1. Make an account on dbGAP/ or get your PI to get you to the study's dbGAP portal as submitter/ manager
2. Get Invitation from dbGAP via Email that contains login access 
3. Submit a questionnaire regarding the data you are trying to uploade/add/fix
4. If you are added to the study as 'manager', you can download all previous dbGAP submission files by doing the following

``` 
1. Study Actions : drop down menu 'download submitted phenotype files'
2. Wait until they send you seperate email for downloading the file
3. Meanwhile, download gpgtool on the local machine following
# Mac users - Download GPGtool binary for OSX here: https://gpgtools.org/
4. When email arrives, you should be able to get gz file of the submitted files
```

4. To keep track of what is updated and what is original, I recommend making a seperate folder, because the file names themselves should not be changed. 
5. Add/ fix data in file 2a, 3a, 5a, 6a, and add/ fix data in excel 5b and 6b (if you add a new variable in 'a' files, they must be reflected in the 'b' excel files in words)
6. Once all files are updated, go back to submission portal of the study, where you will 'replace' the files (2a,3a,5a,6a, (if needed, 5b and 6b)) and 'submit' 
7. Once submission is approved by dbGAP, they will send you a metadat spreadsheet to fill out for newly added/ updated samples.
